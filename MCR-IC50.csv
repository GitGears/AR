CF values greater than 1 are characterized by a lower affinity for the progesterone receptor, and CF values of less than 1 are characterized by higher affinity.

Full Length human mineralocorticoid receptor (hMR) present in a baculovirus infected insect cell lysate is diluted 2 fold in assay buffer and 10 μL of this dilution is added to the assay plate. Blank wells receive 10 μL of the diluted MR lysate containing 3 μM Dexamethasone. 2 μL diluted test compound is transferred to the assay plate for a final starting top concentration of 10 μM in 1% DMSO. The reaction is started by adding 3 μL of 25 nM probe in assay buffer for a final assay concentration of 5 nM.",2014

Compounds were tested in a 7 (Test A1) or 10 (Test A2) concentration response curve ranging from 10 nM to 10 μM (Test A1) or 1 nM to 37 μM (Test A2). Compounds were spotted at the bottom of a well of a 384-well PE Opti-Plate to yield final DMSO concentrations in the assay of 2%. Pre-made MBP-MR/P23 lysate: 3H-aldosterone mix (final assay concentration 7 μg/mL MBP-MR LBD/P23 lysate; 5 nM aldosterone) was added onto the top of the spotted compound and preincubated for 1 h at RT. After 1 h an equal volume anti-rabbit SPA beads coupled with rabbit anti-MBP were added to the assay mixture and incubated for 3 hrs at rt. The inhibition of the scintillation signal by displacement of the bound 3H-aldosterone by test compounds is measured by scintillation counting using a Microbeta Trilux (Wallac).",2016
