Reagents for this assay are purchased from Invitrogen in a test kit. A fluorescent labeled GR ligand is used as a fluorescent tracer and test compounds compete with the fluorescent tracer for GR binding. The change in polarization value in the presence of test compounds is due to binding of test compounds to GR and is used to determine IC50 and relative binding affinity of test compounds for GR.,2014

Reagents for this assay are purchased from Invitrogen in a test kit. A fluorescent labeled GR ligand is used as a fluorescent tracer and test compounds compete with the fluorescent tracer for GR binding. The change in polarization value in the presence of test compounds is due to binding of test compounds to GR and is used to determine IC50 and relative binding affinity of test compounds for GR.,2014

A fluorescent labeled GR ligand is used as a fluorescent tracer and test compounds compete with the fluorescent tracer for GR binding. The change in polarization value in the presence of test compounds is due to binding of test compounds to GR and is used to determine IC50 and relative binding affinity of test compounds for GR.,2014
