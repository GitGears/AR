Urol. 17: 16-23, 1979), which express the human androgen receptor stably and recombinantly (full length, wild-type form, see Swiss-Prot Acc. No. P10275, Entry Version 159, Sequence Version 2). In addition, these PC3 cells contain a stably integrated reporter gene plasmid, which is based on the commercially available plasmid pGL4.14 (#E6691, Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis., USA) and contains the luciferase gene from the American firefly (Photinus pyralis) under the control of the MMTV promoter (Cato et al., EMBO J. 6: 363-368, 1987). These cells were propagated in routine cell culture at 37° C. and 5% CO2 in a medium containing 90% RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany), 100 U penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), 4 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum (FCS Serum Gold, PAA Laboratories GmbH, Cölbe, Germany), 600 μg/ml Geneticin (G418-sulphate, Invitrogen) and 10 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma Aldrich GmbH, Germany). For carrying out the transactivation assays, approx. 1000 cells per well were plated out in a 384-well cell culture plate in a medium that contained activated charcoal-treated calf serum (FCS Serum Gold, PAA Laboratories) at a concentration of 5% (v/v). The test substances were added in a concentration series from 5.12×10^−12 to 1×10^−5 M in the presence of 1×10^−1° R1881 (methyltrienolone). The test plates were incubated overnight at 37° C. and 5% CO2. After 16 hours, 15 μl of Steady Glo Lysis and Detection reagent (E2550, Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis., USA) was added per well and the luminescence was read in a Topcount Luminometer (PerkinElmer, Waltham, Mass., USA) for 4 seconds per well. The luminescence values obtained were normalized, wherein 100% corresponded to the effect of the unstimulated control (without R1881), and 0% corresponded to the effect of the stimulated control (R1881 plus DMSO instead of test substance).",2016,376.415,2.7612,-5.221,7,1,101.04,0,4

Urol. 17: 16-23, 1979), which express the human androgen receptor stably and recombinantly (full length, wild-type form, see Swiss-Prot Acc. No. P10275, Entry Version 159, Sequence Version 2). In addition, these PC3 cells contain a stably integrated reporter gene plasmid, which is based on the commercially available plasmid pGL4.14 (#E6691, Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis., USA) and contains the luciferase gene from the American firefly (Photinus pyralis) under the control of the MMTV promoter (Cato et al., EMBO J. 6: 363-368, 1987). These cells were propagated in routine cell culture at 37° C. and 5% CO2 in a medium containing 90% RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany), 100 U penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), 4 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum (FCS Serum Gold, PAA Laboratories GmbH, Cölbe, Germany), 600 μg/ml Geneticin (G418-sulphate, Invitrogen) and 10 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma Aldrich GmbH, Germany). For carrying out the transactivation assays, approx. 1000 cells per well were plated out in a 384-well cell culture plate in a medium that contained activated charcoal-treated calf serum (FCS Serum Gold, PAA Laboratories) at a concentration of 5% (v/v). The test substances were added in a concentration series from 5.12×10^−12 to 1×10^−5 M in the presence of 1×10^−1° R1881 (methyltrienolone). The test plates were incubated overnight at 37° C. and 5% CO2. After 16 hours, 15 μl of Steady Glo Lysis and Detection reagent (E2550, Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis., USA) was added per well and the luminescence was read in a Topcount Luminometer (PerkinElmer, Waltham, Mass., USA) for 4 seconds per well. The luminescence values obtained were normalized, wherein 100% corresponded to the effect of the unstimulated control (without R1881), and 0% corresponded to the effect of the stimulated control (R1881 plus DMSO instead of test substance).",2016,430.301,3.4476,-4.966,6,1,77.25,0,5

Urol. 17: 16-23, 1979), which express the human androgen receptor stably and recombinantly (full length, wild-type form, see Swiss-Prot Acc. No. P10275, Entry Version 159, Sequence Version 2). In addition, these PC3 cells contain a stably integrated reporter gene plasmid, which is based on the commercially available plasmid pGL4.14 (#E6691, Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis., USA) and contains the luciferase gene from the American firefly (Photinus pyralis) under the control of the MMTV promoter (Cato et al., EMBO J. 6: 363-368, 1987). These cells were propagated in routine cell culture at 37° C. and 5% CO2 in a medium containing 90% RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany), 100 U penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), 4 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum (FCS Serum Gold, PAA Laboratories GmbH, Cölbe, Germany), 600 μg/ml Geneticin (G418-sulphate, Invitrogen) and 10 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma Aldrich GmbH, Germany). For carrying out the transactivation assays, approx. 1000 cells per well were plated out in a 384-well cell culture plate in a medium that contained activated charcoal-treated calf serum (FCS Serum Gold, PAA Laboratories) at a concentration of 5% (v/v). The test substances were added in a concentration series from 5.12×10^−12 to 1×10^−5 M in the presence of 1×10^−1° R1881 (methyltrienolone). The test plates were incubated overnight at 37° C. and 5% CO2. After 16 hours, 15 μl of Steady Glo Lysis and Detection reagent (E2550, Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis., USA) was added per well and the luminescence was read in a Topcount Luminometer (PerkinElmer, Waltham, Mass., USA) for 4 seconds per well. The luminescence values obtained were normalized, wherein 100% corresponded to the effect of the unstimulated control (without R1881), and 0% corresponded to the effect of the stimulated control (R1881 plus DMSO instead of test substance).",2016,376.415,2.558,-4.905,7,1,101.04,0,5

Urol. 17: 16-23, 1979), which express the human androgen receptor stably and recombinantly (full length, wild-type form, see Swiss-Prot Acc. No. P10275, Entry Version 159, Sequence Version 2). In addition, these PC3 cells contain a stably integrated reporter gene plasmid, which is based on the commercially available plasmid pGL4.14 (#E6691, Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis., USA) and contains the luciferase gene from the American firefly (Photinus pyralis) under the control of the MMTV promoter (Cato et al., EMBO J. 6: 363-368, 1987). These cells were propagated in routine cell culture at 37° C. and 5% CO2 in a medium containing 90% RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany), 100 U penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), 4 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum (FCS Serum Gold, PAA Laboratories GmbH, Cölbe, Germany), 600 μg/ml Geneticin (G418-sulphate, Invitrogen) and 10 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma Aldrich GmbH, Germany). For carrying out the transactivation assays, approx. 1000 cells per well were plated out in a 384-well cell culture plate in a medium that contained activated charcoal-treated calf serum (FCS Serum Gold, PAA Laboratories) at a concentration of 5% (v/v). The test substances were added in a concentration series from 5.12×10^−12 to 1×10^−5 M in the presence of 1×10^−1° R1881 (methyltrienolone). The test plates were incubated overnight at 37° C. and 5% CO2. After 16 hours, 15 μl of Steady Glo Lysis and Detection reagent (E2550, Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis., USA) was added per well and the luminescence was read in a Topcount Luminometer (PerkinElmer, Waltham, Mass., USA) for 4 seconds per well. The luminescence values obtained were normalized, wherein 100% corresponded to the effect of the unstimulated control (without R1881), and 0% corresponded to the effect of the stimulated control (R1881 plus DMSO instead of test substance).",2016,368.411,2.3065,-3.922,6,2,79.9,0,5

Briefly, 1 ul of 10 mM compound was added to 500 ul of AR screening buffer in a 1.5 ml eppendorf tube to make a 2x10-5M stock. 10-fold serial dilutions of the test compounds were prepared ranging in concentration from 10-5M to 10-12M. Each dilution was added in triplicate to a black 384-microtiter plate.
